        <p>
            As a member of the OC mens basketball team basketball is another one of my most prominent hobbies.
            It gives me a way to be competitive and get more athletic

        <h1>Computers</h1>
        <p>
            Computers have been a passion of mine since I first started playing minecraft in the 6th grade.
            I hope to be able to make a career out of working with them and helping others learn to use them more
            effectively.
            I also love to code and to make things in HTML and PHP
